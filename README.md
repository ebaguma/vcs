# Valuation Compensation System (VCS)

Integrated Valuation and Compensation System (IVCS) is a system designed to reduce the time involved in valuation, and compensation of Project Affected Persons (PAPs). Compensation processes are often error prone, lack quality control measures, have poor record keeping, and are often lengthy. IVCS is therefore a proposition to take these processes online and also deal with some of the challenges involved. IVCS therefore seeks to address the following challenges in the process of compensation;

- Lengthy Processes
- Mountains of Paperwork
- Lack of Proper Quality Control Measures
- Centralized Resources & Information Repository

Stakeholders using this tool stand to benefit in the following ways:

- Reduced Paperwork
- One Click Reporting
- Concurrent Running of Tasks
- Real time visibility of status
- Reduced risk of data loss
- Instant Access to Information from almost anywhere
